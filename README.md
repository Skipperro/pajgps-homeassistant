## Introduction
Welcome to the PAJ GPS Tracker Integration for Home Assistant!<br>
This integration enables you to effortlessly incorporate PAJ GPS devices from www.paj-gps.de into your Home Assistant setup.

## Disclaimer

- This integration is created with acknowledgement and limited support from PAJ GPS but **this integration is not official software from PAJ UG**.<br>
- It's a custom integration created entirely by me (Skipperro), and thus PAJ UG is not responsible for any damage/issues caused by this integration, nor it offers any end-user support for it.

## Features
- [x] Device tracking (Longitude, Latitude)
- [x] Device battery level
- [x] Device speed

- [ ] Device status (moving, stopped, etc.)
- [ ] Device altitude
- [ ] Notifications (SOS, low battery, etc.)

## Supported devices

While this integration was primarily tested with the **Allround Finder 2G 2.0**, it leverages the standard API provided by PAJ. Therefore, it should be compatible with other PAJ GPS devices. If you encounter any issues with different devices, please report them.
## Installation

1. **Make a proper setup of your PAJ GPS device**. You need to have an account on www.v2.finder-portal.com and your device must be properly configured and connected to the platform.
2. Install this integration with HACS (adding this repository may be required), or copy the contents of this
repository into the `custom_components/pajgps` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Start the configuration flow:
   - [![Start Config Flow](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=pajgps)
   - Or: Go to `Configuration` -> `Integrations` and click the `+ Add Integration`. Select `PAJ GPS` from the list.
   - If the integration is not found try to refresh the HA page without using cache (Ctrl+F5).
4. Provide your email and password used to login on www.v2.finder-portal.com. This data will be saved only in your Home Assistant and is required to generate API token.
5. Device Tracker Entities will be created for all your devices.

## Configuration

The integration will automatically discover all your devices connected to your account on www.v2.finder-portal.com. 
They will be added as entities to Home Assistant based on their ID from the API (not the number on the device).

There is no need to configure anything else.
